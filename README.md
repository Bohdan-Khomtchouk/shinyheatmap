##### R Shiny web app for enormous biological heatmaps

</div>

## About
Purpose: To create user-friendly, highly customizable static and interactive biological heatmaps of big datasets in a web browser.

If you are using `shinyheatmap` in your work, please cite the paper (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0176334).

## Future plans

- [x] Outperform all state-of-the-art heatmap software (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176334.g004)
- [x] Retain the (comfortable) lead
- [x] Add [search functionality](https://github.com/Bohdan-Khomtchouk/fastheatmap/issues/6)
- [ ] Add high performance hierarchical clustering
- [ ] Add a desktop anchor view (i.e., having a "satellite" view when zooming in would be of great help on desktop screens.  In CytoscapeWeb or Cytoscape network visualization tools, for example, when users zoom in/out there is always a small window showing the big picture of the network at its higher level and a rectangle highlighting the region where users zoomed in)
- [ ] Add augmented reality enabled views that can break the heatmap out of a user's desktop directly into the user's spatial environment (work in progress: https://github.com/HeatmapDojo/ar-heatmap)
